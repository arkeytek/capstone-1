    <h1>RK Hudierez</h1>
    <p>Solution Developer</p>
    <hr />
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I am an immigrant to Canada from Philippines and dad to two wonderful boys. On my day job, I'm working as a
        solution developer in
        a local credit union. I like PC gaming and love to spend outdoors with nature, well not so much during winter
        time particularly when the temp dips beyond -15C.
        This is my first ever pure HTML resume, hope this amiable 90's theme is convincing enough to stand out and
        humour your discriminating taste.</p>

Use appropriate HTML tags to format the content of each section, such as h1 for section headings and ul or ol for lists.

Add a footer element with your name and any copyright information or other disclaimers. (Hint: use the MDN docs for things you don't know how to do: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/footer

Save the index.html file and open it in a web browser to ensure that it displays correctly.

Add your website to your GitHub to start building your portfolio.

Requirements

Imagine you are a professional developer working on this project. There will be things you don't know, things you want to do but haven't yet learnt how to. As a professional developer, you need to know the limits of your abilities and look up other things in Google, MDN docs, the internet. -->
